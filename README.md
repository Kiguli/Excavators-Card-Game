# Excavators-Card-Game
HOW TO WIN

The winner of EXCAVATORS is the first player who successfully DIGS all three GEM cards out of their deck (or MINE).  ADD GEMS TO WALLET? PURSE? TREASURE PACK? (Name of zone)

SETUP

Each player needs an EXCAVATOR’S deck of 50 cards and one six-sided dice.

Each deck must contain exactly 3 GEM cards and 20 ROCK or JUNK cards.

The remaining 27 cards in the deck must be unique ACTION or TOOL cards.

Roll a dice to decide who has the first turn. Each player starts the game by removing the GEM cards from their deck, shuffling, and drawing the top three cards as a starting hand. The removed GEM cards are then added into the deck and it is shuffled.

The first player begins the game by starting their DRAW or DIG PHASE and following the steps described in the section ‘PLAYING A TURN’.

After the first player has completed the ROLL PHASE of their turn, play continues clockwise until a winner is decided.

PLAYING A TURN

A player’s turn in EXCAVATORS consists of four phases which are completed in the following order:
1.    DRAW PHASE
2.    MAIN PHASE
3.    EXCAVATION PHASE
4.    ROLL PHASE

At any point in a player's turn, it is possible for their opponent(s) to disrupt their turn by playing cards. At which point the effect of some cards may temporarily override the rules determining how a player’s turn is carried out. More information about cards can be found in the section ‘USING CARDS’.

●    DRAW PHASE
In the DRAW PHASE, a player ‘DIGS’ the top card of the deck, by taking it and adding it to the players hand. If the player successfully DIGS a GEM card, they should immediately play it face-up in front of them. They do not DIG a further card from the top of the deck as a replacement for the played GEM card after doing this.
●    MAIN PHASE
In the MAIN PHASE, a player may play any number of cards from their hand. The majority of ACTION or TOOL cards can only be played during the MAIN PHASE. Cards which are not used in the MAIN PHASE specify this in the body of their card text. The types and uses of cards is discussed in greater detail in the section ‘USING CARDS’.

●    EXCAVATION PHASE
In the EXCAVATION PHASE, the player EXCAVATES six cards from their deck. A player EXCAVATES a card by taking the top card of the deck and placing it face-up on the table in the EXCAVATION ZONE so it can be seen by all players. The first card EXCAVATED is placed in the far left of the zone (in the position marked ‘1’), and each subsequent EXCAVATED card is placed in the position to the right of the previously placed card (positions marked ‘2’, ‘3’, .... up to ‘6’). When all six positions are occupied by an EXCAVATED card, the positioning in the EXCAVATION ZONE will maintain the order the cards were stacked in the deck.

●    ROLL PHASE
In the ROLL PHASE, the player rolls one six-sided dice and DIGS (adds to hand) the card in the position of the EXCAVATION ZONE matching the value on the dice. If the player DIGS a GEM card, that card is immediately placed face-up in front of the player (the player does not reroll or choose another card to DIG if this happens). The remaining EXCAVATED cards are then placed at the bottom of the deck in any order of the players choosing.

USING CARDS
Any number of cards may be used per turn, as long as the conditions and effects of the specific card can be satisfied. There are four main card types in EXCAVATORS. These are:
1.    GEM cards
2.    ROCK or JUNK cards (could have old shoe, tin can, rock, dinosaur bone, etc).
3.    ACTION or TOOL cards
4.    DISRUPTION cards

●    GEM cards
GEM cards are the most important cards in EXCAVATORS. If a player successfully DIGS all three GEM cards and has them lying face-up on the table in front of them, they immediately win the game.

Should a player wish to, they may also sell a GEM card that is lying in front of them on the table. To sell a GEM, the player may look through their deck and add any two cards to their hand, that are not GEM cards. After this, the sold GEM card is added to the deck and the deck is properly shuffled. This is a MAIN PHASE action.

●    ROCK or JUNK cards
ROCK or JUNK cards do nothing on their own and can be considered a dud draw. However, a player can exchange five ROCK or JUNK cards for any one card in their discard pile. The ROCK or JUNK cards would be put into the discard pile and the chosen card in the discard pile would be added to the hand. This is a MAIN PHASE action.

●    ACTION or TOOL cards
ACTION or TOOL cards can be used during the MAIN PHASE of the turn as long as the conditions and the effect written on the card can be satisfied. Some ACTION or TOOL cards specify that they may only be used in a particular phase outside of the MAIN PHASE (e.g. MAGNET 1 may only be used in the ROLL PHASE).

●    DISRUPTION cards
DISRUPTION cards can be used at any point in the game and act instantaneously. The most common use of DISRUPTION cards are to interfere with actions your opponent(s) are trying to make. DISRUPTION cards can also be used defensively, such as to disrupt a DISRUPTION card played by an opponent against the player or to disrupt oneself to create some benefit (e.g. playing MYSTIC STONE swaps the position of two cards during the EXCAVATION PHASE. It can be used offensively to disrupt an opponent’s DIGS or defensively to disrupt your own DIGS and DIG a more preferable card).

When resolving the timing of DISRUPTION cards, every action a player takes has a period that directly follows where an opponent can disrupt. It is therefore not possible for a player to play two cards quickly in succession in order to avoid DISRUPTION cards being played to counter their cards. If a player wishes to disrupt but the turn player has played further cards too quickly, the turn should be brought back to the point where the opponent wished to play their DISRUPTION card. It is against the spirit of the game to undermine this rule by waiting a significant period of time to declare a disruption and attempt to bring the game back when significant actions have since taken place. In such cases the play will continue without the disruption.

STRATEGY

In this section we will discuss some example interactions which may help players develop their strategy. These ideas are not intending to enforce a style of play, rather to encourage creativity in playstyle.
